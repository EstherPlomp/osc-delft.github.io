        Open Science offers new opportunities to advance science. A large part of its attraction is the potential to accelerate the transition from scientific discoveries to real life solutions. Although substantial progress has been achieved in many branches of the Open Science movement (e.g. Open Access, Open Education, FAIR data), the aim of Open Science to help accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries should not be forgotten. With these principles in mind, we will explore successful collaborations between academia and industry based on collaboration, openness and transparency.
        Despite a common (mis)understanding, commercial exploitation is compatible with Open Science and can play a synergistic role reinforcing each other by building trust and increasing impact. But, in order to do so successfully, these two sides need to find common understanding of each otherâ€™s needs and wishes and closely collaborate to maximise the positive impact they can have on society.
        These 'Openness and commercialisation' online events will give insight and room for discussion about the collaborations between academia and industry.

        *Organised by CESAER with contributions from Task Force Open Science and Task Force Innovation, in collaboration with TU Delft, TU Wien, Scientific Knowledge Services, Politecnico di Torino, RWTH Aachen University, Focus on Open Science, and the University of Strathclyde*
